      In this fictional universe, <strong>R.A.I.D.</strong> stands for <em>Rapid Assault and Infiltration Division</em>, 
      an elite covert unit operating in a high‑tech world of espionage, tactical missions, and daring operations. 
      Members of R.A.I.D. are portrayed as highly trained specialists, each contributing unique skills to handle 
      missions ranging from stealth reconnaissance to high‑risk extractions.

      The project was created to explore themes of teamwork, strategy, and creativity, offering a space where 
      stories, ranks, and mission concepts can be shared. Everything here is purely imaginative and intended for fun and storytelling purposes.
