  <h1>ðŸ”’ Classified Report â€“ R.A.I.D. Eyes Only</h1>
  <div class="report">
    <h2>Incident Log â€“ UAE Operations</h2>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> Yesterday (local UAE time)</p>
    <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Internal Security Breach</p>
    <p><strong>Details:</strong></p>
    <p>
      Isaac has been covertly taking photographs of high-value members, including myself, Ayan, and Karas.  
      These images were then transmitted to Talal. Following this, Talal initiated a bounty on our names.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite Talalâ€™s involvement, removing him from R.A.I.D. is currently not an option.  
      If Talal were to be removed, there is a high risk that he would leak classified details of R.A.I.D. to C.O.M.P.  
      This compromise could jeopardize the entire operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      This incident occurred in the UAE. Under UAE regulations, what Isaac did would be considered a punishable offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Status:</strong> Monitoring. No immediate disciplinary action to prevent further leaks.  
      Continue surveillance and document all actions for future review.
